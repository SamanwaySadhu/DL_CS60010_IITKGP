Important points:

1. When working on Google colab run the first 2 cells and rerun them again after restarting runtime, to ensure proper installinon of mxnet    for your runtime.

2. Train and Test data with labels can be found in the link provided in assignment PS. Make sure you add that zip file to your Google          drive.

3. When asked to provide access to your Google drive during runtime, make sure you give access to the correct drive and you copied the        access codes properly.

4. If you are running the code in your local system, you need to download the dataset in your system first. You have to remove the command    which installs mxnet and the cell which giving access to your Google drive. Simpply giving the path of the dataset in your system would    suffice now.

5. Make sure you have all the dependancies and libraries installed before running the code in your system.
